// This is my coditiy test task 2
// I haven't practiced binary tree for a long time. I am unfamilar with it.
// During the test, I spent some time reading and understanding question so I can't finish on time.
// You can see my doubt for the question in the codility pad
// I wrote down that I'll use depth first search and continue working on the task right after
// codiitiy test without reference internet source.
// And this is it. You can run and see the test result.
//
// Hope this make senses
