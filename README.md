# CountVisibleNode

This is my coditiy test task 2
I haven't practiced binary tree for a long time. I am unfamilar with it.
During the test, I spent some time reading and understanding question so I can't finish on time.
You can see my doubt for the question in the codility pad
I wrote down that I'll use depth first search and continue working on the task right after
codiitiy test without reference internet source.
And this is it. You can run and see the test result.
